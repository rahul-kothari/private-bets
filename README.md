Every epoch, participants get 10 memcoins and you PRIVATELY bet which memecoin would have the most liquidity

At the end of the epoch, the bet amounts for each coin get distributed to the coin with most liquidity (winner) and coin with least liquidity (loser)

So anyone betting on the winner or loser gets the liquidity from the middle 8 coins!

This is a simplified version of rug.fun but on Aztec.

Heavily WIP!
